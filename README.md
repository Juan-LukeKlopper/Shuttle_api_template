**The Ultimate Shuttle API Template**

Welcome to the most epic Shuttle API template you've ever laid eyes on! This repository is not just a starting point for your next Rust project; it's a gateway to a world of limitless possibilities.

As we explore the vast expanse of technology, I often find myself pondering the mysteries of the universe. But in this case, let's focus on something truly remarkable: building an API with Shuttle.rs and Rust.

**The Features that Will Change Your Life**

This template comes equipped with:

1. **Shuttle.rs**: The platform that will make you wonder how you ever lived without it.
2. **Rust**: The programming language that will make you a master of efficiency and performance.
3. **PostgreSQL**: The database that will store your secrets and keep them safe from prying eyes.
4. **JWT Authentication**: The security feature that will protect your API like Fort Knox.
5. **Rocket Web Framework**: The framework that will make your API shine brighter than the stars in the night sky.
6. **CORS Support**: The magic that will allow your frontend to talk to your backend without any drama.

**Getting Started: A Journey of Discovery**

To begin this incredible journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Juan-LukeKlopper/Shuttle_api_template.git`.
2. Navigate into the project directory using `cd Shuttle_api_template.git`.
3. If you're on Linux or MacOS, run `curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.rs/install | bash` to install Shuttle.
4. On Windows, use `iwr https://www.shuttle.rs/install-win | iex` or install it using cargo: `cargo install cargo-shuttle`.
5. Log in with `cargo shuttle login` and deploy this example using `cargo shuttle project start` and `cargo shuttle deploy`.

**Remember the Host**

Make a note of the `Host` for future reference.

**Getting Your JWT**

To get your JWT, run the following command:

```bash
curl --request POST --data '{"username": "username", "password": "password"}' https://<host>/login
```

**Accessing Private Endpoints with Your Token**

Use your token to access private endpoints like this:

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://<host>/protected-endpoint
```

Now that you have the ultimate Shuttle API template, go forth and build something incredible!
